# State of the art result for Machine Learning Problems

This repository provides state of the art (SoTA) results for all machine learning problems. We do our best to keep this repository up to date.  If you do find a problem's SoTA result is out of date, please raise this as an issue. I will fix it immediately.

This is an attempt to make  one stop for all types of machine learning problems state of the art result.

This summary is categorized into:
